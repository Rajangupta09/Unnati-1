                For and against gives birth to a parley. A good parliament is
                built with good debaters To provide a platform to many young
                debaters to showcase their talent, Team Unnati organized a
                Parliamentary Debate, where students from all over India
                participated in a huge figure. The chief guest for the event was
                Sharmishtha Mukherjee Ji, spokesperson of AICC; the guiding
                mentor for the event was Amrita Dhawan Ji, President of NSUI.
                The event was enthralling, not just for the debaters but also
                the judges who were actually moved by the thought and words of
                the young children. They were surprised by the enthusiasm shown
                by the youngsters and the way they presented their research. The
                event ended auspiciously with the participation of more than
                1300 students who learnt to speak and present their matter.

                able to go further." Keeping this mantra in mind Unnati kept on
                doing good deeds like when Unnati organized 'Run for Educational
                Excellence', a 6 km marathon for generating proceeds for charity
                and adopting a slum, today known as Udyat. This particular deed

                Career counselling is an essential factor for identifying the
                real potential and guiding students towards a right career path.
                Students needs to know the importance of career coaching and get
                the right guidance before they choose any academic stream. Team
                Unnati took a step forward to guide the fresh minds and teach
                them the importance of different career options in our society.
                With the vast diversity of options available today, it is
                natural for the youngsters to get confused about the field
                appropriate for them. But it is very important to make the right
                choices at the right time so you can work towards it in a proper
                way. UNNATI recognises this on-growing issue of career confusion
                so to help the youth of India, we hosted a Career Counselling
                Session that provided the students with the options available
                and the academic requirement for these. It highly helped the
                students to eliminate and short list the various choices
                available. They all were happy to receive the guidance from some
                of the best experts and were glad to clear some of the doubts
                they had.

                Failure to know and utilize the rights given to individuals
                often leads to their erosion and possibly getting themselves
                deeper into trouble..... So one must be well aware of their
                Constitution and the rights that it imparts us... "Samvidhan se
                Vidhan tak", a seminar on the rights that the Constitution gives
                us was organised by Unnati 28th November'18. One of the root
                causes of the continuous discontentment of the citizens is their
                unawareness. If they had been aware about a certain right or
                procedure, they would have received the justice they deserved. A
                common cause for all the unjust the citizens suffer is because
                of their lack of knowledge about their actual rights and
                measures. To help eradicate this issue, team UNNATI organised a
                session: ‘Samvidhan se Vidhan Tak’ that helped raise awareness,
                amongst the attendees, about their rights and the measures to
                avail these rights. The session was moderated my special guests
